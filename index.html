			<h2>Only RGK provides the Real Made To Measure. Every chair built is made specifically to the recipients measurements
				and their lifestyle requirements, providing the absolute best design and fit available. No off the shelf parts,
				no excess material, no increment sizes. The ergonomic backrest of Fizz's Tiga has an inward taper of 10mm per side.
				Her ergonomic backrest controls how the backrest should interact with her upper body, following the contours of her spine
				to match her body shape.Fizz has an ergonomic seat, with a 120mm flat section at the rear. This helps to better position 
				her pelvis, maintaining a proper posture and making her as comfortable as possible.Her optimised castor
				wheel position is compact and functional, resulting in a perfect balance between creating a compact chair 
				(that allows for practicality) with an optimum rolling resistance.Interested in your own made
				to measure Tiga?</h2>
